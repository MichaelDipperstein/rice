DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains a simple and readable ANSI C implementation of
Rice coding (Golomb-Rice coding) and decoding.  This implementation is not
intended to be the best, fastest, smallest, or any other performance related
adjective.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.  The executable will be named sample (or sample.exe).

USAGE
-----
Usage: sample <options>

options:
  -c : Encode input file to output file.
  -d : Decode input file to output file.
  -k [1-7] : Length of binary portion.
  -i <filename> : Name of input file.
  -o <filename> : Name of output file.
  -h|?  : Print out command line options.

-c      Compress the specified input file (see -i) using the Golomb-Rice
        encoding algorithm.  Results are written to the specified output file
        (see -o).

-d      Decompress the specified input file (see -i) using the Golomb-Rice
        decoding algorithm.  Results are written to the specified output file
        (see -o).  Only files compressed by this program may be decompressed.

-k [1-7]        The number of bits in the binary portion of a Rice encoded
                value.

-i <filename>   The name of the input file.  There is no valid usage of this
                program without a specified input file.

-o <filename>   The name of the output file.  If no file is specified, stdout
                will be used.  NOTE: Sending compressed output to stdout may
                produce undesirable results.

HISTORY
-------
01/23/08  - Initial Release

TODO
----
- Allow unenoded data sizes other than 8 bits.
